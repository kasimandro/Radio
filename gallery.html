 					 <figcaption> 3 of the most beautiful places to visit in Bulgaria – I think it’s quite amazing that Bulgaria is </br>still considered to be off the beaten track for Western tourists, because the country has a bit of everything, and all at very affordable prices.</figcaption>

				 <figcaption>A good place to start is the country’s famous coastline. Bulgaria is known for its Black Sea coastline which has long </br>stretches of sandy beaches dotted with hotels, traditional fishing villages and historical sites. Tourists flock </br>to the glitzier resorts of Sunny Beach and Golden Sands, but I personally believe the city beaches in Varna and Burgas are just as beautiful.</figcaption>

				<figcaption>Known as the Jerusalem of Bulgaria, this picturesque Eastern Orthodox monastery in the forested mountains less </br> than two hours south of Sofia is definitely worth a pilgrimage visit. Named </br>for St. Ivan of Rilski, a tenth century hermit who lived in a nearby cave, the </br> monastery has been built, burnt, and rebuilt over the centuries, with the latest construction dating to the 1800s. </figcaption>
